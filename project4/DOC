EXT2 FILESYSTEM READ-ONLY DRIVER

NAME
    ext2cat - A read-only driver for the ext2 file system
SYNOPSIS
    ext2cat image file_path
DESCRIPTION
    ext2cat reads files from an ext2 file system image and outputs the file to stdout.
OPTIONS
    image
        The path to the ext2 file system image to be read from
    file_path
        The path to the file within the file system image to read and output
DESIGN
    ext2cat
        Parses the user input, loads the file system image, and finds the file the user specified.  Once the file has been
        found in the image, the blocks are output to stdout.  ext2cat can read direct blocks and single-level indirect blocks.
        Data from double-level and triple-level indirect blocks will not be read, so the file output is truncated after reading
        the end of the single-level indirect blocks.
    ext2_access
        Contains helper functions used by ext2cat.  Contains the code that parses the user-specified file path and traverses the
        path, going through the inode and directory contents of each level of the path until it finds the specified file.  Also contains
        code to find the superblock, individual blocks, and inodes from the file image.

VERIFICATION
    Our program successfully passed the testsuite (110%) having been compiled with the ext2cat_sans_ref option.
